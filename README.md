This repository contains a simple C program that showcases a subtle yet common error involving the post-increment operator.  The `bug.c` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.c` provides the corrected version and explanation. The post-increment operator (`x++`) increments the variable *after* its value is used in the expression. This can lead to unexpected results if not fully understood.
